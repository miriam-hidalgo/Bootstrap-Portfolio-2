                <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Miriam Hidalgo and I am an avid web developer. I come from the world of social services and have spent much of my career helping others in any way that I can. In my current job, I am involved in administrative work that faciliates delivering social services to a senior citizen population. Of my many responsibilities my favorite part of the day is when I can create alluring flyers, email blasts, manipulate spreadsheet data, and troubleshoot tech issues.</p> 

                <p>I have found myself creating systems to automate many of the typical day to day office tasks. Little did I know I have been utilizing the same building blocks mirrored in web development. I am happy to say that my eagerness to solve daily work challenges inspired me to complete a Coding Bootcamp offered by Rutgers University. The Bootcamp taught me to channel my creative energies of design and data into the practicum of coding. To know there is a way to organically express my problem-solving nature into something as tangible as a line of code is an exciting realization and a path I am humbled to walk. Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. Please feel free to browse and check out some of the projects that illustrate my coding journey!</p>
